Reasons

1) to keep the domain type specifications above everything else, dependent on nothing

2) to be able to easily communicate the specifications with the domain knowers (my clients) in a human understandable – and not cluttered – language

3) to be able to use the code to generate necessary types and code in whatever syntax necessary; C#, Typescript and Javascript for example

4) to make it possible for easy iterations of “top-level changes” – for me or the business persons themselves to see the results of adding and changing details immediately. Without involving the ordinary developer process.
